# bellow-ios
Bellow for iOS
This repository is a fork from the original 'Ripple' repository. 





A few notes about this repository: 
- This app was formerly named Ripple. Some naming conventions has not been changed in order to quickly meet legal requirements for changing name. 

- Bellow was built utilizing the Parse API. Documentation can be found here: https://parse.com/docs/ios/guide

- There are aspects of this codebase I wish to make more modular and cleaner. Do ask me more if youâ€™re interested in hearing more!
